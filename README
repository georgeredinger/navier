Fluid Dynamics Simulator

Based on Oliver's Simple Fluid Dynamics Simulator, downloaded at random.
So his copyright should remain intact on pressure.js and pressure-display.js.

That, in turn, is based on Jos Stam's GDC03 paper.

PERFORMANCE

JavaScript frame rate, on my machine, determined highly unscientifically:

With display: 40-50 fps
Without display: 50-60 fps, usually 57-58

C frame rate on my machine, similarly determined:

With display: 37fps
Without display: 41fps
Without display at -O3: 64fps

Built with: gcc -Wall -framework GLUT -framework OpenGL -framework Cocoa demo.c solver.c -o demo_solver
Or the same, plus -O3
